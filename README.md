The code will need to be created (in a code editor) and then copied into pastebin so it can then be imported into a turtle within MC via a unique url.

1. Create a new file on pastebin and you will get a URL (Example: https://pastebin.com/q08K0fGE). 
2. Copy the code from your code editor into the raw code section, set the syntax highlighting to Lua, config the rest of the settings, and name the file. Save your changes and copy the end part of the URL (Example: q08K0fGE).
3. Launch MC and when logged in, right click on your turtle access the terminal and inventory slots.
4. Place the items in the correct slots.
4. In your turtle terminal, navigate to the directory where you want to import the program from pastebin.
5. Type the following command: pastebin get q08K0fGE street_lamp
6. After a few moments the program will finish importing. You can now run the program by typing in it's name: street_lamp
7. Exit the turtle terminal and watch it go to work.
